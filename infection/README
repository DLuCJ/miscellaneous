Hello!
This is the Infection program, written in python.  
This is using python 3.5  It's untested with other versions.

To run:
   :$ python infection.py

The main routine executes two sets of tests.

All you should see as output is an "All tests pass" and then output from
the limited_infection test listing users and versions, and the number
of infected users.

Thoughts are in doc-strings in the file.
But feel free to ask if you need clarification on anything.


NOTE:
So, I was thinking about limited_infection a bit today, and I realize that 
it's probably got a big problem.

When I check if there are conflicts in prev's connection list, I actually
mean that I want to check for conflicts in prev's entire reachable graph.
So I suppose that I can change count_reachable to return a Counter instead,
and have Counter hold both the list of reachable users and the count.

Then, prev points to a (User, Counter) tuple and we can check the Counter's
reachable users list for conflicts instead.

But, I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to make any changes to the code right now, 
so this just a way for me to remember where I went wrong.

But I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to make any changes
