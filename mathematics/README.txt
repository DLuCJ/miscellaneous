Learning project for undergraduate mathematics (and maybe more) and common lisp (SBCL version 1.2.7) 
Will implement as I learn

This is not intended for use by others, but you might find something interesting.
It probably won't be well documented aside from some comments here and there.


To use:

install mathematics to quicklisp/local-projects/
(ql:quickload :mathematics)


Currently studying:

Simple approximate eigensolver using a modified Gram-Schmidt QR factorization
Rayleigh quotient iteration or normal inverse iteration depending on what sort of EV we want (largest or smallest).
